# Basic_Calci_infinite_precision
##### This project is done in C language.
# TITLE OF THE PROJECT: Basic Calculator NAME: Pradnya Kailas Navale. 
# DISCRIPTION OF PROJECT: I have implemented Basic oprations i.e, Addition, Substraction, multiplication, division, modulas, comparision functions like "&lt;=, >=, &lt;, >, ==, =!" and sine, cosine, tan. The comparision oprators gives 1 if condition is true ,0 if condition is false. And the comparision function that I made does the following thing: 1.makes the dec of the two list equal. 2.makes the length of the two list equal. 3.and gives 1 when l1 is greater than l2 else gives 0. I have also implemented infix expression. I have used stack and list. and for tokneising the string I used the getnext function which gives me a no. as list and also the operator as a list. and then my_infix function call the basic operation depends on the input oprations. I used the show function in list which gives me the current number. for printing the list i used the traverse function in list which prints the list i.e, the list with no decimal and the list with decimal.
